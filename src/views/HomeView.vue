    <h1>Welcome to Wargamelistbuilder.com.</h1>
    <h5>Currently, I am a single developer and this app is in heavy development.</h5>
    <h5>
      The purpose of the app is to allow table top game players to develop army lists easily. At the
      moment, the only game loaded is Warhammer: Old World
    </h5>
    <h5>
      If you want to add another game like Warhammer 40k, go to the settings pages where you can add
      what you want. Thanks and happy list building!
    </h5>
